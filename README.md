# anipianolist (name is a work-in-progress)
> "ok guys we need to make the myanimelist of all piano arrangements" â€“ fruit 2022

## Getting started 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anipiano/anipianolist
cd anipianolist
source env/bin/activate
#edit your .env before starting
python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Before you dive in
- We use Django 4.1.4 with PostgreSQL 14.5 and Python 3.11.1 as the backbone of this project
- Smaller code changes can be committed, but significant changes should be PR'd and reviewed before merging with the main branch
- If you have any trouble with anything, feel free to ask in #anipianolist on Yeh's server :D although things might look difficult, just remind yourself nothing is more difficult than Animenz Sincerely :kekw:
- Feedback is welcome in #anipianolist on Yeh's server or #collab on Fruit's server. Or just spam ping every contributor on this GitHub repo (no don't actually do this :facepalmcry:)

### Authentication

You'll need to register applications in both Discord and Google to use OAuth2 authentication.

1. **Discord** -
2. **Google** - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials > OAuth2 client ID > Web application > redirect URI: `http://replace-me-you-baka.net/oauth2/google/login/callback/`

### Database
You'll need to set some things up before you can spam your love for 150bpm in every row of the object-relational database. We use PostgreSQL over the default SQLite3 setup due to its support for write concurrency and generally better performance in our specific production use case.

This guide assumes you're running a derivative of Ubuntu or Debian, but you should easily be able to substitute commands for Microsoft Windows, other Linux distributions or macOS where necessary. 

Thanks to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-20-04) for being my senpai for this guide.

1. Start by installing the necessary psql-related dependencies for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distributions:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

2. Log into a `psql` session.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

3. In the `postgres=#` console, set up your PostgreSQL database. Feel free to change names like `myproject` and `myprojectuser` to something more descriptive.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myproject;
CREATE USER myprojectuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE USER myprojectuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE myproject TO myprojectuser;
```

You can leave the console with `\q`.

4. In `$ROOT/anipianolist/anipianolist/.env`, where `$ROOT` is the root of the git repository as given by `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, you'll need to amend the environment variables with the credentials you set up in Step 3. **This should not be committed** and will be automatically ignored as specified by `.gitignore`.

```bash
...
DB_NAME=myproject
DB_USERNAME=myprojectuser
DB_PASSWORD=password
...
``` 

### Environment variables
Use the provided `.env.example` template to set up your environment variables for local or production instances.
```
$ROOT/anipianolist/anipianolist/.env
``` 
where `$ROOT` is the root of the git repository as given by `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

## Apps
Different components of the anipianolist application are segmented into their own app.

- **accounts** - handles account management, IAM, profiles, authentication (note this is different from `account` which is an app in `django-allauth`)
- **base** - handles the base of the site (e.g index page, general viewing pages)
